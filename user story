## user stories

The user can find the optimal value of radius and position which maximizes and sum radius^2. 

 1. The user can get a limited square whose length of side is bounded by [-1,1].
 2. In the square, there are some small dots which act as blocks at the certain position.
 3. The user can get the exact number of ballons.
 4. The user can obtain the maximum radius and the position of the ballons which do not overlap with those blocks.
 5. The user can view the sum of squares of the variable radius.
 6. The area of all circles has maximum value.
